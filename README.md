Pixel Art Ninja Game Generator
This is a Python-based application that uses the Llama LLM via the TogetherAI API to generate Python code for creating pixel art games. Specifically, it provides a framework for building simple pixel art ninja games where users can control a ninja character and interact with enemies.

Features:
Pixel Art Ninja Game: Create a simple ninja game where the player controls a ninja and fights against enemies.
Llama LLM Integration: Uses TogetherAI's API to leverage the Llama LLM for automatic code generation.
Customizable: Customize your game with various assets, including pixel art images for the ninja, enemies, and background.
Movement and Combat: The ninja can move around the screen, and players can engage with enemies through basic interaction.
How It Works:
This application allows you to generate Python code that uses the Pygame library to create a pixel art ninja game. It uses a set of pre-designed assets (ninja characters, enemies, background) and provides the code for handling game logic like movement, combat, and collision detection. By leveraging Llama LLM through TogetherAI, the game code is generated based on natural language descriptions provided by the user.

Game Features:
Player Control: The player can move the ninja character using arrow keys.
Enemy Interaction: The player can defeat enemies using a "cut" action triggered by a key press.
Background: A customizable pixel art background is added to the game screen.
Pixel Art Assets: Includes several pixel art images of the ninja in different poses and states (running, attacking, and dead).
Installation:
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
pygame library
API key for TogetherAI
Steps:
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-art-ninja-game-generator.git
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
pip install together
Set up the API key:

Create an account with TogetherAI and obtain an API key.
Store the API key in your .env or pass it directly in the script.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python ninja_game.py
Usage:
Once the application is running, use the arrow keys to move the ninja.
Press the "space" bar to attack enemies.
Enemies will be randomly placed on the screen, and the player can "cut" them upon collision.
Assets:
Ninja Images: Various animations for running, attacking, and dying.
Enemy Images: Multiple variations of enemy ninjas for gameplay.
Background: Pixel art background for the game screen.
